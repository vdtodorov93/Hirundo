Hirundo
=======

Hirundo is a social network, very similar to twitter.
The interface is very simple and user friendly, providing only the most-needed features.
First of all, you need to make a registration with an unique username and then sign in.
Having done that, you are able to browse among all the users and follow anyone.
On the "Timeline" page, you will see the last messages, posted by the people you follow.
Of course, you have the option to unfollow someone, if you don't want to receive his posts.
At anytime, you can submit a post, and everyone following you will see it in his Timeline.
